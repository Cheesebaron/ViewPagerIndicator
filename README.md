ViewPagerIndicator
==========================

[![Build Status](https://osteost.visualstudio.com/ViewPagerIndicator/_apis/build/status/Cheesebaron.ViewPagerIndicator?branchName=master)](https://osteost.visualstudio.com/ViewPagerIndicator/_build/latest?definitionId=7&branchName=master)

Paging indicator widgets that are compatible with the `ViewPager` from the
[Android Support Library][2] to improve discoverability of content.

> For Material Design look at [PagerSlidingTabStrip](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/PagerSlidingTabStrip-for-Xamarin.Android)

Usage
=====

*For a working implementation of this project see the `sample` solution.*

  1. Include one of the widgets in your view. This should usually be placed
     adjacent to the `ViewPager` it represents.

        <dk.ostebaronen.droid.viewpagerindicator.TitlePageIndicator
            android:id="@+id/titles"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:layout_width="match_parent" />

  2. In your `OnCreate` method (or `OnCreateView` for a fragment), bind the
     indicator to the `ViewPager`.

         //Set the pager with an adapter
         var pager = FindViewById<ViewPager>(Resource.Id.pager);
         pager.Adapter = new TestAdapter(SupportFragmentManager);

         //Bind the title indicator to the adapter
         var titleIndicator = FindViewById<TitlePageIndicator>(Resource.Id.titles);
         titleIndicator.SetViewPager(pager);

  3. *(Optional)* If you want to listen for a `PageChange` event, you should use it
	 on the `ViewPagerIndicator`, rather than setting an `OnPageChangeListener` on the
	 `ViewPager`, otherwise the `ViewPagerIndicator` will not update.

         //continued from above
         titleIndicator.PageChange += MyPageChangeEventHandler;


Theming
-------

There are three ways to style the look of the indicators.

 1. **Theme XML**. An attribute for each type of indicator is provided in which
    you can specify a custom style.
 2. **Layout XML**. Through the use of a custom namespace you can include any
    desired styles.
 3. **Object methods**. Both styles have Properties for each style
    attribute which can be changed at any point.

Each indicator has a demo which creates the same look using each of these
methods.


Including In Your Project
-------------------------

ViewPagerIndicator is an Android Library project, which you can reference in
your Android Project.

This project depends on the `ViewPager` class which is available in the
[Android Support Library][2].
